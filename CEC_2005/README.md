# Compare different optimization techniques on CEC 2005 functions

Functions from the CECâ€™2005 suite of benchmark functions:

Source for the matlab files:
https://www.al-roomi.org/benchmarks/cec-database/cec-2005

a_genetic_algorithm.m & a_swarm_optimization_algorithm will run a Genetic Algorithm Optimization and Swarm Optimization Algorithm with 15 iterations for 2D, 10D and 100D using specific functions (2 and 7 for this example).

Modify and run both these files to compare the performance of different functions. It will generate CSV files with the results.
